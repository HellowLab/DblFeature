## Setup Instructions

Setting up the DblFeature development environment is straightforward, thanks to React Native Expoâ€™s powerful tools. Below are the detailed instructions to get you up and running.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

1. **Node Version Manager (nvm):**

   - Install nvm by following the instructions on the [nvm GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Nvm allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on your machine.

2. **Node.js (v20 or later):**

   - Use nvm to install Node.js version 20. You can do this with the following commands:
     ```bash
     nvm install 20
     nvm use 20
     ```

3. **Expo CLI:**

   - Install the Expo CLI globally using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g expo-cli
     ```

4. **EAS CLI (Expo Application Services):**

   - Install the EAS CLI globally using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install -g eas-cli
     ```

5. **Android Studio:**

   - Android Studio is required for Android development. Download and install it from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio). Ensure that the Android SDK is correctly configured.

6. **Xcode:**
   - Xcode is required for iOS development and is only available on macOS. Download and install it from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Ensure you have set up Xcode with the necessary iOS SDKs.

### Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and install all necessary dependencies:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hellowlab/DblFeature.git
   cd DblFeature
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Using nvm:**

   - Ensure you are using the correct Node.js version:
     ```bash
     nvm install 20
     nvm use 20
     ```

3. **Install Global Dependencies:**

   - Install Expo CLI and EAS CLI globally if you haven't done so already:
     ```bash
     npm install -g expo-cli eas-cli
     ```

4. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   - Install all the projectâ€™s dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

5.**Optional Setup Script:** - The repository includes a setup script that automates the installation process:
`bash
     chmod +x setup.sh
     ./setup.sh
     `
**Note:** The setup script is not frequently updated, so manual verification is recommended. If the global Node.js version isnâ€™t set correctly, you can manually switch to Node 20 by running `nvm use 20`.

### Running the App

To start developing, you must first generate a build on your device. Follow these steps based on your development environment:

1.**Generate a Build on iOS:** - Use this command to build and run the app on an iOS simulator or device:
`bash
     npx expo run:ios`

2.**Generate a Build on Android:** - Use this command to build and run the app on an Android emulator or device:
`bash
     npx expo run:android`

3.**Start the Development Server:** - Once the initial build is complete, start the Expo development server:
`bash
     npx expo start
     `

You will have the option to open the app in a development build, an Android emulator, an iOS simulator, or Expo Go. The development server will hot-reload changes as you make them, allowing for rapid iteration.

## Usage Guide

The following guide provides detailed instructions on how to use, test, and deploy the DblFeature application.

### Running the Application

1. **Development Build:** - After running the `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android` command, you can use `npx expo start` to run the application in development mode.

2. **Testing:** - Currently, there are no automated tests integrated into the project. Manual testing should be conducted to ensure that new features work as expected.

3. **Deployment:** - Deployment procedures will be introduced as the project evolves. For now, ensure that builds are thoroughly tested before being pushed to production environments.

### Common Commands

- **Starting the Development Server (Development Builds for iOS/Android):**

  ```bash
  npx expo start
  ```

  When prompted, type 'a' to run on an android simulator or 'i' to run on an iOS simulator.

- **Building a Production Build for Android Deployment:**

  ```bash
  eas build --platform android
  ```

- **Building a Production Build for iOS Deployment:**
  ```bash
  eas build --platform ios
  ```

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributing to DblFeature is welcome and encouraged! Please adhere to the following guidelines to maintain code quality and streamline collaboration.

### Branch Management

1. **Issue Branches:**

   - When working on an issue, create a new branch from `integration` named after the GitHub issue ticket, following this pattern:
     ```plaintext
     30-add-new-feature
     ```
     Where 30 is the ticket number, and Add New Feature is the name of the ticket.

2. **Pull Requests to Integration:**

   - Once your work on a feature or bug fix is complete, submit a pull request (PR) to the `integration` branch. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `integration` before submitting the PR.

3. **Pull Requests to Master:**
   - After completing and testing all tickets for a sprint, a PR from `integration` to `master` is created. This PR must be reviewed and approved by a Code Owner. Our branch protection rules ensure that no changes can be merged into `master` without approval.

### Coding Standards

1. **Code Quality:**

   - Follow best practices in your code, including clear naming conventions, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, and modular design.

2. **Prettier Formatting:**

   - The project uses Prettier for code formatting with the default TypeScript settings. If you are using VS Code, ensure that you have the Prettier extension installed:
     - **Installing Prettier in VS Code:**
       1. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
       2. Search for "Prettier - Code formatter" and install it.
     - **Setting Prettier as the Default Formatter:**
       1. Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "Format Document With..."
       2. Select "Configure Default Formatter..." and choose "Prettier - Code formatter."

### Pull Request Procedure

1. **Descriptive PRs:**

   - When creating a PR, include a clear and concise description of the changes made. Link the relevant GitHub issue in the description.

2. **Review Process:**

   - Every PR should be reviewed by at least one other developer. For PRs to `master`, approval from a Code Owner is required, as enforced by our branch protection rules.

3. **Testing:**

   - Thoroughly test your changes before submitting a PR. This includes manual testing on both Android and iOS platforms, ensuring cross-device compatibility.

4. **Merging:**
   - Only merge a PR once it has been approved and all required status checks have passed. Use the "Squash and merge" option to keep the commit history clean.

## Environment Variables

To properly run the project, you need to configure a `.env` file in the root of the repository with the following environment variables:

```plaintext
EXPO_PUBLIC_TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tmdb_access_token
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://10.0.2.2:8000/"  # For Android
```

### Local Backend Setup

During development, the app relies on a backend service that you need to set up locally. To do this:

1. **Clone the Backend Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HellowLab/HellowLabBackend_Django.git
   ```

2. **Follow the Instructions:**
   - Navigate to the backend repository and follow the instructions in its README to get the backend up and running.

### API Base URL for iOS

- If you are testing the app on iOS and running the backend locally, update your `.env` file with the following:
  ```plaintext
  EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/"
  ```

**Note:** Once the backend is hosted and no longer running locally, the `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` will be updated accordingly, and running the backend locally will no longer be necessary.
