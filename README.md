# Welcome to DblFeature ðŸ‘‹

This is a React Native project created with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). This app uses The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch and display movie information.

DblFeature is a fun and engaging app designed for people to find the perfect movie match to watch together. With a Tinder-style interface, users can swipe through movie options to get personalized recommendations based on their preferences. The app also provides suggestions for movie snacks to enhance the viewing experience. Whether you're in the mood for a romantic comedy or an action-packed thriller, DblFeature helps couples discover the ideal movie for a cozy night in.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Node.js (v22.2 or later)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [EAS CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/cli/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hellowlab/DblFeature.git
cd DblFeature
nvm install 22.2
nvm use 22.2
npm install -g expo-cli eas-cli
npm install
```

Alternatively, you can run the provided setup script to automate the above steps:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This script will:

- Install nvm if not already installed.
- Use the Node.js version specified in the .nodeversion file.
  - If no .nodeversion file exists, one is made and default version is set to 20.
- Install global dependencies (expo-cli, eas-cli).
- Install project dependencies.
- Update specific dependencies to the latest versions.
- Fix Watchman recrawl warnings.

### Running the App

Start the Expo development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** and **src** directories.

### Building for Android

To build the app for Android:

1. Ensure you have Android Studio installed and configured.
2. Run the following command to create an Android build:

```bash
eas build --platform android
```

### Building for iOS

To build the app for iOS:

1. Ensure you have Xcode installed and configured.
2. Run the following command to create an iOS build:

```bash
eas build --platform ios
```

Note: Building for iOS requires a macOS environment.
